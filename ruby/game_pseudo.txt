#ask player #1 for a phrase

#assign player 2 a fixed number of guesses (equal to 2x length of phrase)
#create a "board" for player 2

#ask player 2 for his first guess	
	#if the character is included in the phrase, fill the board with the matching characters
		#deduct one guess
		#if board is complete, player 2 wins - end game
	#if the character is not included in the phrase, just deduct one guess from player 2 budget

#continue asking player 2 for guesses until either he wins or runs out of guesses
