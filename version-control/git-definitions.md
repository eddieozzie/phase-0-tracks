# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Verison control is a method of keeping track of different states or versions of a codebase. It is robust because code can be diverged, merged, and saved for later use quickly. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is simply a divergence in in the codebase. It is often used for implementing a new feature, so the main codebase can remain intact, and developers can work on different aspects of the codebase simultaneously. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a entry into version control. It can be recalled later. Good commit messages are concise, yet descriptive. 
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two branches have differing edits of the same part of code. When this happens, you can specify to git which of the edits should be used.
